I am a second year Ph.D. student in the [Minnesota NLP group](http://cs-u-ada.cs.umn.edu/) led by [Prof. Dongyeop Kang](https://dykang.github.io/) at [University of Minnesota Twin Cities](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/). <br>

My research interests focus on the intersection of discourse analysis, multilinguality, and conditional language generation.
In particular, I am currently interested in improving the performance of document-level multilingual discourse analysis through self-supervision and multi-task learning; and applying the learned discourse information to generative tasks such as interactive and iterative text generation.

Previously, I worked as a researcher at [NAVER LABS Europe](https://europe.naverlabs.com/) and [Papago](https://papago.naver.com/) team at [NAVER Korea](https://naver.com/), where I researched on various topics in neural machine translation (NMT), such as analysis of language-pair-specific multilingual representation, document-level NMT with discourse information, cross-attention-based website translation, and quality estimation for evaluating NMT models.

I received a B.Eng. degree in Computer Science from [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) in 2011.
From 2012 to 2013, I served in the Republic of Korea Army Special Forces as an army interpreter.
In 2016, I received an M.S. degree in Computer Science from [Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/).
